# Pong Game in Python

A simple recreation of the classic Pong game built using Python's Turtle graphics. This game allows two players to control paddles and keep the ball in play. The game ends when the player closes the window.

## Features
- Two paddles controlled by players
  - Player 1 (Left Paddle): `W` to move up, `S` to move down
  - Player 2 (Right Paddle): `Up Arrow` to move up, `Down Arrow` to move down
- Ball bounces off the walls and paddles
- A point is scored when the opponent misses the ball
- The game can be closed at any time by pressing the `Escape` key

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.6+).
2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ORomero227/Pong-Arcade-Game.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pong-game
    ```
4. Ensure you have the Turtle module installed. Turtle is a standard Python library, so no additional installation should be needed.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Control the paddles:
   - Left paddle (Player 1): Use the `W` key to move up, and the `S` key to move down.
   - Right paddle (Player 2): Use the `Up` arrow to move up, and the `Down` arrow to move down.

3. The ball will start moving automatically, bouncing off the walls and paddles.
4. When a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
5. You can quit the game anytime by pressing the `Escape` key.
